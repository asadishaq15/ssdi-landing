            Citizens Disability is committed to helping keep people safe from fraud. We will never ask for personal details to start an SSDI application over Facebook or social media. We will only ask for certain details, in private messages, to confirm the identity of a client in a customer service situation. The only way to begin an SSDI application with us is on the phone, through a number found on our website, or one of our clearly-marked advertisements. Please keep your personal details safe, don't share them in a public forum, or with individuals who solicit your information.

            Citizens Disability is a disability advocacy group that advocates for people with SSDI or SSI claims pending before the Social Security Administration. We provide advocacy services for Americans who are disabled and unable to work. We help claimants with applications for Social Security Disability benefits. While we have many attorneys on our staff, we are not a law firm and do not provide legal service or represent claimants in an attorney-client relationship in this process.
